## Welcome to my GitHub profile! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

- 🔭 I’m a II year Ph.D. student of the [Department of Control and Computer Engineering](https://www.dauin.polito.it/) at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en). In particular, I am a member of the [e-Lite research group](https://elite.polito.it/).
- 🔍 You can find my publications on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luca-Mannella) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ecwAbEYAAAAJ).
- 🤔 The main theme of my PhD is "Supporting developers in the Cybersecurity of IoT Systems", so my works are mainly related to IoT Security. In this last period, I am working on the security of Cloud-IoT solutions with a focus on Smart Homes. Recently, I proposed a threat model for extensible smart home gateways and I am further investigating security issues during the development of [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) additional components (like integration or add-ons).
- :teacher: From 2021, I was (one of) the teaching assistant(s) of Web Application I at Politecnico di Torino — a course focused on the front-end of web application (using React framework). This year I am involved only in one of the two english courses. Here you can find a reference to the [course's website](https://elite.polito.it/teaching/current-courses/556-01txyov-wa1).
